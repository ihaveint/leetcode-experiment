I initially started this as an experiment to see how fast I'm able to solve these questions using C++, which is the main lagnuage I use for competitive programming. But as I'm solving more problems, I'm experimenting with different languages to see what sticks. I'm not timing anything for languages other than C++ right now because I'm not "super" fast with anything other than C++.

I do have a vision of expanding this project soon to actually do something useful with it, but more on that later ;)
