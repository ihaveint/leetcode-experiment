Doing an experiment to see how fast I'm able to do these questions after all these years :)

I guess at some point if I continue doing this, I'll try solving problems with different languages. Right now it's mainly C++.

Right now, I don't keep track of the times for languages other than C++. I'm practicing their syntax since it's been a while I coded in anything other than C++ and python :)
